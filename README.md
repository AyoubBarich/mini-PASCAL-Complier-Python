# PascalLike Compiler in Python

## Overview
This repository hosts a compiler implemented in Python for a language inspired by PASCAL. The compiler translates source code written in this language into executable code.

## Features
- **Lexical Analysis:** Tokenizes the source code into a stream of meaningful tokens.
- **Syntax Parsing:** Implements a parser for analyzing the grammatical structure of the source code.
- **Semantic Analysis:** Performs semantic checks to ensure the correctness of the code.
- **Intermediate Code Generation:** Translates the source code into an intermediate representation.
- **Code Generation:** Generates executable code from the optimized intermediate representation.

## Language Features
- **Strong Typing:** Enforces strong typing to enhance code reliability.
- **Variable Declarations:** Allows variable declarations with explicit data types.
- **Basic Operations:** addition , multiplication, division.


## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AyoubBarich/mini-PASCAL-Complier-Python/
2. Compile a basic programme:
   ```bash
   python3 compile.py programme_file_directory
